What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates .git and this makes git repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	In git, there are three directories git, staging and working. Let's say you have two files in the working dir and they are not linked with eachother. In other VCS we have to commit all files in the dir but in the git we can specify which files to be committed. This is why git introduced staging area. we add files which are not linked to the staging area and then commit independently.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	we can add required files to be committed in the staging area.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	If you want to try out any new features, we can create a brach with a label. If someone asked the code, we can checkout to master branch.
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	It creates a new commit merging both branches
